# Product Listing Custom Carousel

## No Assembly Required

This custom carousel was built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are no frameworks here. After cloning the repo to your local machine either opening index.html in your browser, or using an extension like _Live Server_ in VS Code will run the page. No need to npm install or load bulky CDN's. Just plain vanilla code.

## Responsiveness

Even though responsiveness was not a necessary requirement for this carousel project, a good amount was added. For phone screens, the arrows are removed to encourage a streamlined multi-touch gesture swipe and for larger screens, say above 1440px, the carousel container automatically resizes so it scales correctly. A little more could be done here, but the basics have been implemented, plus the requirements.
